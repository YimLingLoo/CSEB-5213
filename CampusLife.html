    <h1>About Uniten Putrajaya</h1>
    <h2>The Remarkable Journey of UNITEN</h2>
    <p>The UNITEN Putrajaya campus, in effect, began to take shape in 1995 involving three stages of development and construction covering an area of 483 acres. Its close proximity to the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) and the federal administrative centre Putrajaya simply added to UNITEN's air of auspiciousness.
        According to Tun Abdul Aziz bin Noh, the first Rector of UNITEN, "The university's primary mission is to provide quality education and training in engineering, information technology, business and related fields for Malaysians and other nationals." By 1999, student enrollment in this state-of-the-art teaching and learning environment had reached an impressive 5,000.
        About a year later, on 29 June 2000, the Malaysia Prime Minister, Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad officially opened the UNITEN Putrajaya campus.
        This further spurred the university to reach greater heights which saw it move from strength to strength consolidating its stature as a university of choice. That same year also saw the first intake of students in UNITEN's very own bachelor's degree programme.</p>
